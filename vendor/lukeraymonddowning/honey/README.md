## Installation
You can install Honey via Composer.

```bash
composer require lukeraymonddowning/honey
```

You should publish Honey's config file using the following [Artisan](https://laravel.com/docs/master/artisan) Command:

```bash
php artisan honey:install
```

Finally, you should run your database migrations, which adds a spammers table:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

Honey is now successfully installed!

## Upgrading

> :warning: 0.3.0 has a number of tiny breaking changes. Check out the upgrade guide in UPGRADE.md

We document any changes in the UPGRADE.md file.

## Usage
Using Honey couldn't be easier. Go to a `<form>` in your blade files and add `<x-honey/>` as a child element.

```blade
<form action="{{ route('some.route') }}" method="POST">
    @csrf
    <input type="email" placeholder="Your email" required />
    <x-honey/>
    <button type="submit">Subscribe!</button>
</form>
```

Now, in the routes file, add the `honey` middleware to the route that your form points to.

```php
// routes/web.php

Route::post('/test', fn() => event(new RegisterInterest))
    ->middleware(['honey'])
    ->name('some.route');
```

That's it! Your route is now protected from spam. If you want to take it to the next level, read on...

### Recaptcha

Honey makes it a breeze to integrate Google's [Recaptcha](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha) on your Laravel
site. We integrate with Recaptcha v3 for completely seamless and invisible bot prevention. Here's how to get started.

First, you need to go grab a key pair from Google. You can get yours here: 
[https://g.co/recaptcha/v3](https://g.co/recaptcha/v3). Head into your `.env` file, and add your key pair.

```dotenv
# .env

RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY
```

We're almost there. Head to your blade file and, inside of a `<form>` element, add the `<x-honey-recaptcha/>` component.
We'll use the example from earlier:

```blade
<form action="{{ route('some.route') }}" method="POST">
    @csrf
    <input type="email" placeholder="Your email" required />
    <x-honey/>
    <x-honey-recaptcha/> 
    <button type="submit">Subscribe!</button>
</form>
```

As a note, you can use `<x-honey-recaptcha/>` alongside `<x-honey/>`, or separately. You do you. However, if
you're using both components, you can simplify to this:

```blade
<x-honey recaptcha/>
```

To allow you to track different action types in your Google console, you can pass an action attribute
to the recaptcha blade component.

```blade
<x-honey-recaptcha action="signup"/>

// Or...
<x-honey recaptcha="signup"/>
```

You now have 2 options. You can allow Honey to make the Recaptcha request for you and fail automatically if it
detects a bot, or you can do it manually (although it's basically magic, so don't worry).

#### Via Middleware

To use Honey's built in Middleware, add `honey-recaptcha` to your route's middleware stack:

```php
// routes/web.php

Route::post('/test', fn() => event(new RegisterInterest))
    ->middleware(['honey', 'honey-recaptcha'])
    ->name('some.route');
```

Again, you can use this independently of the `honey` middleware if you're only interested in Recaptcha. The middleware
will abort the request by default if things look fishy.

#### Manually

Honey provides you all the power you could ever wish for via the `Honey` Facade. To check the token manually, you may
do the following:

```php
$token = request()->honey_recapture_token;
$response = Honey::recaptcha()->check($token);
```

The response will return a `RecaptchaResponse` object with properties as defined in the Recaptcha docs: [https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/v3).
This class implements `ArrayAccess`, so you can use array syntax as if you were working with a JSON response.

```php
$token = request()->honey_recapture_token;
$score = Honey::recaptcha()->check($token)['score'];
```

If you want to quickly ascertain if the request is spam based on your configured minimum score, you can use the 
`isSpam` method after calling the `check` method.

```php
$token = request()->honey_recapture_token;
$probablyABot = Honey::recaptcha()->check($token)->isSpam();
``` 

### Customising what happens on failure
By default, Honey will abort with a `422` status code when it detects spam through its middleware stack.
Of course, you may wish to do something completely different. No problem! Just tell Honey what it should do instead
in the boot method of your Service Provider:

```php
public function boot()
{
    Honey::failUsing(function() {
        abort(404, "Move along. Nothing to see here...");
    });
}
```

### Hooks
Honey allows you to perform callbacks prior to it failing due to a spam attack. You can register as many callbacks
as you want. To register a callback, call the `beforeFailing` method.

```php
Honey::beforeFailing(fn() => Log::alert("A bot is trying to access our site. Red alert!"));
```

Honey also allows you to hook in after a recaptcha token has been checked on the server. This is used in the Livewire
traits to force a request for a new token on the next render.

```php
Honey::recaptcha()->afterRequesting(fn($response) => Log::info("This user got a reCaptcha score of {$response['score']}"));
```

### Manually running Honey checks
You can manually run any checks defined in your `checks` array in the `honey.php` config file using the Facade helper.

```php
$noSpam = Honey::check(request()->all());
```

Note that this won't fail for you, but will return a boolean instead. You can force a failure if desired:

```php
Honey::fail();
```

### Integrating with Livewire
Honey offers out of the box [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com) support. To get started, add the 
`WithHoney` trait to your Livewire component. You don't need to change your form at all, everything will
just work. Note that the honey inputs are [deferred](https://laravel-livewire.com/docs/2.x/properties#deferred-updating),
so they'll only sync back to the server after calling an action. Here's an example form:

```blade
<form wire:submit.prevent="signup">
    @csrf
    <input type="email" placeholder="Your email" required />
    <x-honey/>
    <button type="submit">Subscribe!</button>
</form>
```

When the form is submitted and the `signup` action is called, the Honey inputs will sync back to your component.
In your component, you can check if Honey passed by calling `$this->honeyPasses()`. Note that your standard fail
method will not be called in Livewire components, because the use case is so different.

Honey also supports reCaptcha for Livewire. Again, your form just needs to include the recaptcha component or 
include the `recaptcha` attribute on the `<x-honey/>` component:

```blade
<form wire:submit.prevent="signup">
    @csrf
    <input type="email" placeholder="Your email" required />
    <x-honey recaptcha/>
    <button type="submit">Subscribe!</button>
</form>
```

You also need to add the `WithRecaptcha` trait to your Livewire component (even if you're using Honey too). You can
check for reCaptcha success by calling `$this->recaptchaPasses()`. If you're using `WithHoney`, the `$this->honeyPasses()`
method will also check reCaptcha for you, so there is no need to call both methods.

The `WithRecaptcha` trait is smart enough to request a new token from the browser if, for example, your token check passes
but your validation fails.

### Configuring Honey
Honey is built with a great set of defaults, but we understand that one size rarely fits all. That's why we provide
plenty of config options for you. You can access them from the `honey.php` config file. Let's look at the
different options available to you.

#### Features
You can disable or enable global features provided by Honey simply by adding or removing them from the `features` array. 
Here are the features on offer:

##### Spammer IP Tracking
When enabled, Honey will add a `spammers` migration to your database. Any time somebody fails the spam check, their
IP address is added to the `spammers` table. If you don't want Honey to track this, simply disable the feature.

##### Block Spammers Globally
If spammer IP tracking is enabled, Honey can go one step further. By default, it registers global middleware that
will block any IP address in the `spammers` table that has hit the `maximum_attempts` defined further down in the
config file. If you would like more granular control or wish to remove this functionality entirely, simply disable the feature.

#### Environments
You likely don't want to run Honey in every environment. Honey will only run in the environments specified in this array.
You can also manually disable Honey by calling the `disable` method.

```php
Honey::disable();
```

#### Checks
Each time the `honey` middleware is run or `Honey::check()` is called, Honey runs through an array of checks to determine
if the request is spam. You can tailor which checks are to be run by adding or removing items in the `checks` array.

##### User is blocked spammer check
This requires the `spammerIpTracking` feature to be enabled to take effect. If an IP address is recorded as hitting the
`maximum_attempts` of spamming defined further down in the config file, it will fail.

##### Present but empty check
When you include the `<x-honey/>` blade directive, Honey adds a hidden input to your form. If a bot fills this input
out, or removes the input from the request, this check will fail.

##### Minimum time passed check 
When you include the `<x-honey/>` blade directive, Honey adds a hidden input to your form with the current time in it as an encrypted value. 
If the form is submitted faster than defined in the `minimum_time_passed` config entry, or removes the input from the request, 
this check will fail.

##### Javascript input filled check
When you include the `<x-honey/>` blade directive, Honey adds a hidden input to your form. It starts empty, but after
the time specified in the `minimum_time_passed` config entry, Javascript fills the input with an encrypted value.
If the input has been filled out with a different value, or has no value, the check will fail.

#### Minimum time passed
If you have the minimum time passed check or the Javascript input filled check enabled, both checks will use this value
to determine, in seconds, the minimum amount of time that should pass from the page loading until the form can be 
submitted. Forms that are submitted more quickly than this will fail the spam check.

#### Spammer blocking
If you have the `spammerIpTracking` feature enabled, you can configure the options for it here. The `table_name`
entry allows you to change the name of the database table if it conflicts with something else in your application.
The `maximum_attempts` entry defines the maximum number of times an IP address can be recorded as spam before they
are blocked from the site. We recommend setting a value higher than 1 to account for occasional mistakes.

#### Input name selectors
By default, Honey uses the `static` driver to decide on input names. If you would like to change the name of each
input, you may do so here. We recommend altering these from the default values to prevent learned bot behaviour across
sites.

#### Recaptcha
Here you can define your key pair if you don't want to do it in the env file. You may also alter the minimum score
(between 0 and 1), that a user must get back from Recaptcha to avoid being classed as spam.

## Testing

Honey has a full test suite. Go ahead and run it for yourself!

```bash
composer test
```

## Accreditations

My main impetus for creating this package came after watching Jefferey Way's brilliant course on Spam prevention
on Laracasts. If you don't have a Laracasts subscription, you should get one.
